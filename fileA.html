<h1>CHESS BOXING (not boxing chess)</h1>
<p>Chess boxing, or chessboxing, is a hybrid fighting sport that combines two traditional sports, chess and boxing. 
The competitors fight in alternating rounds of chess and boxing.
Chessboxing was invented by Dutch performance artist Iepe Rubingh. What was initially only thought to be an art performance quickly turned into a fully developed competitive sport.</p>
